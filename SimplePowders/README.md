This is a mod for Cataclysm: the last generation to alter ingame items.

To install, just drag the folder named SimplePowders into the mod folder of the game install, CTLG/data/mods

This modification replaces the different types of small arms powders to be replaced by a basic powder, as well as creating a gunpowder recipe loosely based on cordite.
